We all know that buying a car in Sri Lanka is a huge asset. Therefore the second hand car market is so strong here in Sri Lanka. But it is always tricky to buy a used car since these cars were here for a really long time. And most of the us SriLankans are so good at quick fixes rather than spending good money on vehicles.

## 10.  Tires and Wheels
Yes we all know respectively to the amount you spend on your car, tires are super cheep. But in **most cases** you buy a used car means you are not super rich. So once you buy your car, you would not get a chance to or you would not feel like changing the tires. But it is important for both your safty and the other parts of the car to have good soild set of tires on your wheels.

> *All you need to do is check if the tires are new and check if it has enough tire tread depth*

## 09.  The 4 Shock absorbers
Shock absorbers does play a huge part in keeping your car's health in good condition. Buying a car with bad shock absorbers means in few weeks your other suspension parts will also be calling you. So to avoid that press the car from all 4 corners and see if the car goes does down and comes back to its original place without bouncing.

## 08.  Steering wheel wear and tear
Steering wheel is a good way to find out if your car milage shows on the clock is correct. And how abusive or good were the previous owners. 7 out of 10 if the steering wheel of the car is not in good condition, you need to walk away from the car

## 07.  Car interior
You car could be 1000 years old, but still the intrior needs to be in perfect condition. Specially door panel and upholstery. Reduing these interior would cost more than you ever think. Damaged seat covers are not cool. try every button on the dashboard and see if everything works.

## 06.  Dashbord
Yes the dashboad, we all know how that gives your car that new look. I really love the leather padded dashbord on BMW 46 and on the old honda accords. You always can ask the owner to reduce the price in good 20 25k if the car dashboard is not in the condition how it should be. People who cannot keep the dashboard clean probably never would have cared about the car anyway.

## 05.  Check for cataloy on the body
If the car you are trying to buy is very old, There is huge chance that your car contains cataloy on the body. Old means the car could have been respraid few times for many resons. When you hit the metal with your nails you know the sound, but if you hit a spot of cataloy, that sound changes. Cataloy is not a deal breaker but too much cataloy is. And the reason which the painter had to use it.

Eg: lets say that you find cataloy on the roof. Then this is a huge concern since the reason he did a repair on the roof could be the car has turned upside down in an accident. Or something fell on to the roof.

## 04.  Maintenance service history
If the car you are trying to buy has a service history, that is so awsome. It tell you how often the car has been serviced and what repires has been done so far and what has to be done. A person who collects the service records means that he has cared the car so much.

## 03.  Accident free car
I personaly belive even if a car has met with a serious accident, its still ok as long as they have fixed it correctly. But the fact is in Sri Lanka we dont belive that as a nation ;). So the second hand value of that car would be decreased drastically.

## 02.  Inspection by a mechanic
Its always better to get the car inspected by a mechanic before buying. Or if possoble take the car to one of the places where they do inspections. Few places you can look for inspections are
- Softlogic automobiles Rajagiriya
- LAUGFS Car Care
- Car Checks (Pvt) Ltd.

## 01 The body condition.
You can replace all the mechanical part of a vehicle. But the body is a tricky case. Lets say your car is bit too old, there is a high chance of your car has rust on it. Rust is a car killer. The body of the car should have clean stright lines. But if the car is bit old there is a high chance that the body has small dents and uneven line on it. A bad body is unfixable without applying loads of cataloy to your car. So when you buy, you need to buy the best you can.

> Hope you guys will buy a great used car :D
